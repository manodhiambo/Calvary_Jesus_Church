			<h2>Home</h2>
			<p>Calvary Jesus Church is based on Biblical doctrine solely. We believe that the Bible is complete on its own and nothing exists outside the Bible claimed to be from God is true. Our faith is based on the fact that, “Long ago, at many times and in many ways , God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days, He has spoken to us  by His Son, Whom He appointed the Heir of all things, through whom also, He created the world…..(Hebrews 1:1-2)”… In addition, that the Prophets and Apostles, after laying the foundation, we now built on it. This means that the only way God can communicate is through the Bible and not through dreams, visions, etc..
			This gives us the reasons to rely solely on the Bible and hence the reason to study the Bible.
			</p>
			<p>Why then is it important to study the Bible?</p>
			<p>Because it contains God’s mind and Will for our lives (2 Timothy 3:16-17). It is the only source of absolute divine authority for you as a servant of Jesus Christ.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is infallible in its totality: “The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple” (Ps. 19:7).</li>
				<li>It is infallible/inerrant in its parts: “Every word of God proves true; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. Do not add to His Words , lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar ” (Prov. 30:5-6)</li>
				<li>It is complete: “I warn everyone who hears the words  of the prophesy of this book : if anyone add to them , God will add to him the plagues described in this book , and if anyone takes away  from the words of the book of this prophesy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book” (Rev. 22:19-19).
				</li>
				<li>It is authoritative and final: “Forever O Lord, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens ”(Ps. 119:89)</li>
				<li>It is sufficient for your needs: “…that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work” (2Timothy 3:16-17).</li>
				<li>It will accomplish what  it promises: “so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and shall succeed in the things for which I sent it” (Isa. 55:11)</li>
				<li>It provides the assurance of your salvation: “Whoever is of God hears the word of God” (John 8:47).</li>

			    <h2>About Us</h2>
			        <p>We are a group of believers with a common faith based on the following Biblical facts:.</p>
				    <ul>
					    <li>All human kind are born in Adam, sinners by birth: “Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death  through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned--”(Romans 5:12).</li>
					    <li>This therefore means that there is none righteous before God : “None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God” (Rom. 3:10).</li>
					    <li>God is righteous and Just and can never allow sin into heaven: “……A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is He…..”(Deut. 32:4)</li>
					    <li>No good deed from man can be used to justify him and make him right with God : “yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ , so we also have  believed  in Christ Jesus , in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified” (Gal. 2:16)</li>
					    <li>According to the law(The Ten Commandments) if out of your ten good deeds, one is wrong, this makes you guilty of all of them : “For whoever keeps the whole law  but fails in one point has become guilty of all”(James 2:10)</li>
					    <li>God can never forgive sin without shedding of blood: “Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified by with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins”(Hebrews 9:22).</li>
					    <li>And the only available blood(sacrifice) is Jesus Christ : “Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, “Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for me ;… ””(Hebrews 10:5-10).</li>
					    <li>The only way therefore one can be righteous, right with God is through the forgiveness :“Let it be known to you  therefore , brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses”(Acts 13:38-39).</li>
					    <li>Without Jesus Christ nobody can enter heaven : “….I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me”(John 14:6)</li>
					    <li>We believe that through Jesus’ death , the believers are saved from the wrath to come(Hell): “Much more then , having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him”(Rom. 5:9; 1Thess. 1:10).</li>
					    <li>
